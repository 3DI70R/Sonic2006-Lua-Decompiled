# Sonic2006-Lua-Decompiled
Code from game Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) decompiled using Unluac tool for educational purposes

This code is not 100% correct.
It can contain various errors, such as empty branches, invalid for loops, and other bugs
---
This branch is my attempt to fix decompiled code, so it can run on arbitrary lua virtual machine. Hovewer, this doesn't mean that this code will run on original game.
